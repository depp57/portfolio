  <h1>
    SOFT SKILLS
  </h1>
  <p>
    During my free time, I enjoy reading and watching english content, going from computer science tutorials to
    entrepreneurship pitches.
    <br>I especially like TED Talks, which let me learn interesting soft skills, like how to speak a public.
    <br>In addition, many activities offered by my english & soft skills class helped me to develop more soft skills,
    including :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing a <b>CV</b> and <b>cover letter</b>.</li>
    <li>Organizing, chairing and taking minutes during a <b>meeting</b>.</li>
    <li>Working on a project as a <b>team</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Professionalism</b> : punctuality and mutual respect.</li>
  </ul>
