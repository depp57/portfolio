I am currently working on my portfolio, this is just a preview where I can ask for advices.

## Overview

- `backend` - All the backend of the website, currently there is only a mailer.
- `frontend` - All the frontend developed with angular, including a 2D and a 3D version of the website.

## Built using

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - 3D part of the portfolio

## Running locally

You won't be able to get the backend to work without a php server, 
but this is not important because the main part of the project is located in the frontend.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/depp57/portfolio.git
$ cd portfolio/frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
